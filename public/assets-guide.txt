SAL'S PUBLIC ASSETS GUIDE (URGENT)
----------------------------------

To ensure your impressive "Live Demos" section stays visually complete, follow these steps exactly:

1. MANUALLY UPLOAD the following 5 images into the 'public' folder of your local project:
   - infographic.png (for INFOVISION)
   - chrome.png      (for CHROME EXTENSION BUILDER BOT)
   - salspend.png    (for SALSPEND)
   - story.png       (for VIRAL FACTORY)
   - history.png     (for HISTORIA)

2. GIT PERSISTENCE: 
   If these files are being deleted during sync/deployment, it is likely because your build process or .gitignore is excluding the 'public' folder or binary assets. 

   ACTION: 
   - Ensure 'public' is NOT in your .gitignore.
   - If using a specialized deployment tool, verify that the 'public' folder is marked as a "Static Asset" directory.

3. RE-SYNC:
   Once the files are manually added to your local 'public' folder, perform a fresh 'git add public/' and 'git commit'. This will ensure they are permanently tracked in your repository.

The application is now programmed to show "Neural Fallback" visuals if these files are missing, ensuring your site never looks broken!
